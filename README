Package enc provides a simple interface for encrypting and decrypting data to
a useful format.

First, the data item is encoded to as a gob. Next, the encoding is compressed
to the gzip format. This is encrypted with AES-256 in Galois/Counter mode.
The input password is derived with argon2i and the hash is used as the key to
AES. The output data is in the following format.

	[enc version][argon2 salt][AES nonce][encrypted data]

This format aims for minimal data size (from gzip), data integrity (from
GCM), and data confidentiality (from AES).
